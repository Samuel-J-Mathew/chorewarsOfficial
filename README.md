## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Flutter doctor shows issues**
   - Follow the recommended steps provided by `flutter doctor` to resolve them
   - Make sure all necessary Android SDK components are installed

2. **Emulator fails to start**
   - Ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS
   - Check if you have enough free disk space
   - Try creating a new emulator with different specifications

3. **Build errors**
   - Run `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`
   - Ensure your Flutter SDK is up to date with `flutter upgrade`

4. **Firebase connection issues**
   - Verify that the `google-services.json` file is correctly placed in the `android/app/` directory
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Ensure the Firebase project is properly set up with the correct services enabled

5. **SDK version mismatch**
   - Update your Flutter SDK to match the version specified in the pubspec.yaml file
   - Run `flutter --version` to check your current version

6. **Android Studio can't find Flutter SDK**
   - Go to Android Studio > Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter
   - Set the Flutter SDK path to where you installed it

### Common Issues and Solutions (Windows) {#common-issues-and-solutions-windows}

1. **Flutter doctor shows issues**
   - Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute the suggested fixes
   - Install any missing dependencies with their Windows installers

2. **Path issues**
   - Verify that Flutter is properly added to your PATH
   - Restart PowerShell or Command Prompt after updating PATH
   - Use `where flutter` command to check if Flutter is in your PATH

3. **Android emulator not starting**
   - Enable Hyper-V in Windows features
   - Make sure Windows Hypervisor Platform is enabled
   - Disable Hyper-V if using another virtualization tool like VirtualBox

4. **VS Code doesn't detect Flutter**
   - Restart VS Code after installing Flutter extension
   - Use Command Palette and run "Flutter: New Project" to verify installation

5. **Permission issues**
   - Run VS Code or Android Studio as Administrator
   - Check Windows Defender or antivirus settings that might block execution

6. **Gradle build failures**
   - Check if your Windows username has special characters which can cause path issues
   - Use shorter paths for your Flutter and project directories
   - Make sure Android SDK location doesn't contain spaces or special characters

### Common Issues and Solutions (Linux) {#common-issues-and-solutions-linux}

1. **Missing dependencies**
   - Run `flutter doctor` to identify missing dependencies
   - Install required packages with your distribution's package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libstdc++-12-dev
   ```

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Adjust file permissions with `chmod`:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/development/flutter/bin/flutter
   ```

3. **AVD acceleration issues**
   - Install KVM for hardware acceleration:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
   sudo adduser $USER kvm
   sudo chown $USER /dev/kvm
   ```

4. **VS Code extension problems**
   - Remove and reinstall the Flutter extension
   - Check VS Code logs (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

5. **Snap package issues**
   - If using snap, try installing Flutter manually instead
   - Make sure snap has correct permissions

6. **HAXM not supported**
   - Linux uses KVM instead of HAXM for acceleration
   - Ensure CPU supports virtualization and it's enabled in BIOS
